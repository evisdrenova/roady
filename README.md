# Roady Roadmap

- retain the ticket info if user is signing in for the first time since right now it goes away, probably use local storage for this
- replace the upvotes in a title with a link to the issue with it's generated id, the link should be a url to the expanded modal view
- check for duplicate ticket names before submitting
- handle responsiveness
